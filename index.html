    <p>
        Fashion designer and businesswoman
        <ul><li>
 From science to one of the most iconic brands in the fashion world - Coco
      Chanel was a woman who changed the face of fashion forever.
        </li>
    <li>  She was born
      in France and taught herself to sew at a young age - something that would
      certainly come in handy later on!</li>
    <li>     She opened her first shop in the early
      1900s, starting off by designing hats. She soon turned her attention to
      clothes too and, by the 1920s, launched her first perfume.</li><li> Ever heard of
      the saying the 'little black dress', also known as the LBD? Yep, you have
      Coco Chanel to thank for that.

      </li>
    <li>
 She led the way in luxury fashion and today
      her brand - led by its creative director Karl Lagerfeld - sells clothes,
      perfume, handbags and watches. Almost 100 years after it was first
      created, Chanel No 5 is still probably the world's most famous perfume!
    </li>
   <li>All from one hat shop, Chanel is now worth billions of pounds, so it's
      safe to say she had one heck of an impact!</li> </ul>
